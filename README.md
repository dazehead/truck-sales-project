## Used Truck Sales Analysis for Class A Heavy Duty Trucks

* start with truck_sales which is a Jupyter Notebook
* The SQLite folder holds DataBase file after it has been cleaned
* Tableau folder holds a png of the dashboard; however, there is a link to my Tableau profile in the Jupyter Notbook where you can interactact with the dashboard

#### I learned a lot during this project and I hope to get some good feedback on any possible upgrades

I am starting to take Intermediate and Advanced Python and I would like some suggestions on how I could incorporate the unpacking operator `*` or maybe the `@` decorator operator.
